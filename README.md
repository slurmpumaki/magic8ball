# 🔮 Magic 8-Ball (Python)

A tiny little Magic 8-Ball I made in Python.  
You type any yes/no question, and it gives you a fun, random answer — just like the real toy, but with a little extra sparkle. ✨

## What It Does

- Gives you a random fortune from a list of responses  
- Uses Python’s `random` module  
- Simple, fast, and beginner-friendly

- VS Code  
- Replit or any online Python editor
